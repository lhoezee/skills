/**
 * Run manager: headless `claude -p` conversations.
 *
 * A run is one conversation; each turn (the first prompt, or a reply) is a new
 * `claude -p` process on the same session (--session-id on turn 1, --resume
 * after). The process exits when Claude ends its turn. Everything a turn prints
 * (stream-json) is appended to the run's event log and fanned out over SSE.
 *
 * Headless gaps it papers over:
 *  - AskUserQuestion doesn't work under -p. The appended system prompt asks
 *    Claude to end its turn with a <<QUESTION>>{json}<</QUESTION>> block
 *    instead; the run then waits for your answer (status "waiting").
 *  - Background work dies with the process. The prompt forbids it, and each
 *    turn records what was backgrounded and flags anything that was cut off.
 *  - Plan mode is a per-run switch applied per turn, so a read-only question
 *    can turn into real work without starting over.
 *
 * Ledger layout (under <main workspace>/.claude/ledger/, gitignored):
 *   runs/<id>.json          RunMeta
 *   runs/<id>.events.jsonl  every event, one per line (CLI events + dashboard markers)

export const HEADLESS_RULES = `You are running headless inside the workspace dashboard (claude -p). The AskUserQuestion tool is not available and there is no terminal to type into.
Whenever you would call AskUserQuestion, or you otherwise need a decision from the user before you can continue (an approval gate, a choice between options, missing input), do NOT guess, do NOT skip the step, and do NOT treat silence as approval. Instead, end your turn with exactly one block in this format and then stop:
<<QUESTION>>
{"questions":[{"question":"<full question>","header":"<short label>","multiSelect":false,"options":[{"label":"<option>","description":"<what it means>"}]}]}
<</QUESTION>>
Put any explanation the user needs before the block. The user's answer arrives as your next message. Approval gates must always be surfaced this way, never bypassed. Skills that say to use AskUserQuestion mean this block here.

Background work does not survive here. This process exits the moment your turn ends, and everything it started in the background is killed with it; no task notification will re-invoke you after that.
So, overriding any skill or instruction that says otherwise (for example a code-review skill, or "run_in_background: true"):
- Never set run_in_background (on Bash or on the Agent tool), and never plan to "wait for a notification". Subagents are fine: call the Agent tool normally, in the foreground, and wait for its result.
- Run long commands in the foreground and wait for them, with a Bash timeout of up to 600000 ms. If one needs longer than 10 minutes, tell the user it has to continue in a terminal.
- A process that must keep running after your turn (e.g. dev servers) cannot be started as a background task: it dies when this process exits. If a workspace skill or script starts it as a detached OS process that outlives this one (e.g. a --detached mode), use that when the user asks for it, and tell them how to stop it. Otherwise say so and point to the dashboard's Apps page (it starts and stops the workspace apps) or a terminal.
- Never tell the user a background task is still running at the end of your turn; it will not be. Only a process you started detached (above) is still running, and only if you checked it came up.
- Don't schedule recurring checks (CronCreate, /loop, ScheduleWakeup, Monitor): the schedule stops when your turn ends.
- To keep monitoring GitHub pull requests (a PR monitor, babysitting reviews or checks), do one check now, then end your turn with a watch block instead of a loop. The dashboard checks the PRs every few minutes and resumes this conversation only when something changes (a new review or comment, checks failing, the branch falling behind or conflicting, approval), sending you the changes followed by your prompt. It stops by itself once every PR is merged or closed.
<<WATCH>>
{"prs":["owner/repo#123"],"everyMinutes":5,"prompt":"<what to do on each wake-up: the monitoring cycle>"}
<</WATCH>>
  A watch stays on across turns. End a later turn with a new block to replace it, or with <<WATCH>>{"stop":true}<</WATCH>> to end it. For any other ongoing monitoring, do one check now and suggest a terminal.

Don't end on a to-do list for the user. If you finish with follow-up steps you could do yourself (commit, open a PR, deploy, publish, update the ticket), end with the question block offering to do them, recommended option first, instead of listing them as "next steps". Otherwise the dashboard shows the run as Done while work is still waiting.

The same goes for handing work back: if your turn ends with the user doing something and reporting back (test a change, reload a page, add a secret, check an email, try again), end with the question block too, e.g. "How did it go?" with options like "It worked", "It failed (I'll paste the error)" and "Still testing". End without a block only when the work is actually finished.`;
