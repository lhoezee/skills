# Dashboard config reference

Everything team-specific lives in `<workspace>/.claude/dashboard/` (committed) plus `brand/`. Every file is optional: a page without its config explains how to set it up. Files are re-read when they change; edits apply on the next page load (only `dashboard.port` needs a restart). `$comment` keys are ignored; keep one at the top of each file saying what it is.

Personal/local state is in `<workspace>/.claude/ledger/` (gitignored): run history, attachments, settings overrides, pasted tracker keys, personal links, the dashboard token and log.

Running it on company infrastructure for people without a dev machine (hosted mode) is set by environment variables, not these files: see [hosting.md](hosting.md).

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | folder name | Sidebar (when there's no logo) and page titles. |
| `dashboard.port` | 3333 | `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var overrides it per machine; `--port` per start. Must not clash with an app port. |
| `dashboard.devPort` | 4339 | The UI dev server (`npm run dev` in the engine folder) allowed to call the server. Keep in step with `angular.json`'s serve port. |
| `dashboard.legacyRedirects` | none | Old tools' ports that should redirect into the dashboard. |
| `worktrees.dir` | `worktrees` | Where per-ticket worktrees live (Workspaces page lists `<dir>/*` with a `.worktree.json`). Native `git worktree`s are found too, wherever they are: see "Worktrees" below. |
| `worktrees.portsFile` | `~/.agentic-workspace-ports.json` | Per-user file of worktree ports: `{ worktrees: { <name>: { slot, workspace, ports: { <appId>: port } } } }`. Written by the team's worktree tooling, or by the dashboard when `worktrees.ports` is set. |
| `worktrees.ports` | none | `{ "base": 24000, "slotSize": 100 }`: the dashboard gives each worktree a port slot on its first start, `base + slot × slotSize + slotOffset` per app, and records it in the ports file. Leave it out when the team's tooling allocates. |
| `worktrees.screenshots` | `.claude/qa-artifacts/screenshots` | QA screenshots shown per workspace. |
| `issues.kind` | `none` | `linear` \| `jira` \| `github` \| `none` (or any adapter you add). |
| `issues.label` | per kind | Shown in the UI. |
| `issues.implementStates` | Linear `Todo`, Jira `To Do`, GitHub `Open` | Issues in these states get the Implement button (with `deck.json` `issues.implementTeams`). |
| `issues.ticketPattern` | `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-\d+$` (GitHub: `^[\w.-]+#\d+$`) | Anchored regex for a ticket id. |
| `issues.urlTemplate` | from the adapter | Issue URL with `{id}`, if the adapter can't build one. |
| (per person) | none | Each person can narrow their own board with "My filter" on the Issues page: JQL for Jira (ANDed in), search qualifiers for GitHub. Saved in their `.claude/ledger/settings.json`, never in the team config. Linear has no query language, so no field. |
| Linear | `org` | The workspace slug in `linear.app/<org>/...`. Key: pasted on the Issues page (`lin_api_…`) or `LINEAR_API_KEY`. |
| Jira | `site`, `projects` | `acme.atlassian.net`; project keys or names. Key: `email:api-token` pasted on the Issues page, or `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN`. |
| GitHub Issues | `repos` (or `repo`), `states` | `["owner/name", …]`; `states` maps board columns to labels, e.g. `{ "In progress": ["in progress"] }` (open issues with none = "Open"). Ids are `<repo>#<n>`. Uses `gh` login. |
| `codeHost.kind` | `github` | The Home page's Needs-you inbox (your PRs, reviews requested, red CI). `github` uses the `gh` CLI; `none` turns it off. |
| `codeHost.ciRepos` / `ciBranch` | `[]` / `main` | Repos (`owner/name`) that get a CI health dot. |
| `brand.logo` / `favicon` | none | Files in `brand/`. Use a light logo: the sidebar is dark. No logo = the `name` as text. |
| `copy` | none | Wording overrides: `linksSub`, `docsSub`, `infrastructureSub`, `issuesSub`, `connectionsSub`, `searchExamples` (array), `askPlaceholder`. |
| `roles` | Developer, Reader | The roles people pick from, in order: `{ "<id>": { label, description?, profile?, outputStyle?, hiddenPages?, hiddenSkills? } }`. See **Roles** below. With `roles` set, everyone is asked which is theirs (the Windows installer asks first; the dashboard asks on first start); without it nobody is asked. |
| `profiles.reader` | `{ hiddenPages: ["apps", "workspaces"], hiddenSkills: [] }` | What every role on the **reader** profile hides (people who read and ask about the code but don't build or run it); each role adds its own. `hiddenPages`: nav routes (Home also drops the tiles of a hidden page: Apps up, Workspaces). `hiddenSkills`: project skills. Readers never get Implement. |

### Roles

Each person's role is theirs alone (kept in `.claude/ledger/profile.json`, changed in Settings → Role). A role sets:

- **`profile`**: `developer` (default: everything) or `reader` (no Implement, no Publish now, plus `profiles.reader`'s hidden pages and skills). Machine checks can say `when: { profile }` or `when: { role }`.
- **`hiddenPages`** / **`hiddenSkills`**: on top of the profile's. Hidden skills are set to `"off"` in that person's `.claude/settings.local.json` `skillOverrides`, which takes them out of Claude's `/` menu and refuses them by name.
- **`outputStyle`**: how Claude answers them, e.g. plain language with the app and file a thing lives in instead of method names and line numbers. The name of a [Claude Code output style](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles): a team one in `.claude/output-styles/<name>.md` (give it `keep-coding-instructions: true`, or Claude drops its software-engineering instructions), or a built-in one. It's written to `outputStyle` in their `settings.local.json`, so it applies in the terminal, the desktop app and the dashboard's runs; it doesn't reach subagents, whose answers the main conversation passes on.

Changing role takes back only what the dashboard set there: a skill override or output style the person set themselves is kept. When `workspace.json` changes, everyone's settings follow at the next dashboard start.

```json
"profiles": { "reader": { "hiddenSkills": ["run", "stop", "worktree", "pr"] } },
"roles": {
  "engineering": { "label": "Engineering", "description": "Builds, runs and ships the code." },

## apps.json: the Apps and Workspaces pages

```json
{

  },
  "stacks": {
    "platform": { "label": "Platform", "description": "MySQL, API, then web", "hint": "Compose up, API, then web",

        { "start": ["api"] },
        { "start": "rest" }
      ] }
  }
}
```

**App fields:** `name`, `type` (label), `dir` (workspace-relative folder; the app is "not cloned" when missing), `workDir` (a sub-folder, e.g. in a monorepo; also where the command runs), `group`, `port` (main-workspace port; the dashboard marks the app up when it answers. Leave it out for an app that never listens, like a queue worker: it counts as started once its process has stayed alive for a few seconds, and as running while that process is alive), `https`, `mainOnly` (never runs in worktrees; always its fixed port), `fallback: "main"` (in a worktree that isn't running this app, or hasn't cloned it, its dependents use main's instance: `{{port:<id>}}` names main's port, and a worktree stack that includes it starts or reuses main's; for shared backends and services a worktree usually doesn't change), `slotOffset` (its offset inside a worktree port slot; default its 1-based position in `apps`), `bootSeconds` (how long to wait before calling a start failed, default 120), `logFile` (an extra log the app writes; `{tmp}` and `{workspace}` expand).

**launch** is one of:
- `{ "cmd": "...", "cwd"?: "sub/folder", "env"?: { ... } }`: a shell command, run detached (it outlives the dashboard) in `workDir`/`dir` (+`cwd`). `{{port}}` (this app's port), `{{port:<appId>}}` and `{{workspace}}` expand in `cmd` and `env`. Stop sends its process tree SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 10s if anything is left. Starting an app whose earlier launch is still alive but not answering stops that one first.
- `{ "launcher": "<args>", "detached"?: true }`: the team's own launcher script, `launcher.script` below, called as `node <script> <args> --workspace <path>`. `detached: true` for long-running commands; without it the command must start the app and return. Stop runs `launcher.stop` with `{app}` replaced.

**Top level:** `launcher: { script, stop: "stop {app}", workspaceArg: "--workspace" | null }`; `setup: { label, cmd | launcher, timeoutMin }` (a one-time setup step: stacks can run it, and the Machine page's "Run setup" button uses it); `groups` (display order and labels); `defaultStack` (what a workspace's "Start stack" button starts).

**Stack steps**, in order: `{ "setup": true }` · `{ "start": ["id", …] }` or `{ "start": "rest" }` (the ones not started yet, in parallel) · `{ "wait": "all" | ["id"] }` (`"all"` = every app started so far) · `{ "cmd": "...", "label", "timeoutMin" }` · `{ "launcher": "...", "label", "timeoutMin" }`. No `steps` = start every app at once.

**Worktrees.** The Workspaces page lists main plus every worktree it finds: entries in the ports file, `worktrees.dir/*` folders with a `.worktree.json`, and native `git worktree`s of the workspace's repos. A git worktree of the root repo (a monorepo, or a workspace that is itself a repo) is a workspace; a git worktree of an app's repo counts when it sits at `<workspace>/<repo folder>`, so `git -C api worktree add ../trees/ENG-7/api` and `git -C web worktree add ../trees/ENG-7/web` make one workspace, `trees/ENG-7`. Its ticket comes from `.worktree.json` `ticketId`, else from the branch name (`issues.ticketPattern`). Repos shown per workspace: `.worktree.json` `repos`, else the repo holding each app's `dir`, else the root itself (`.`). A worktree gets a Start button for each stack it has an app of, not just `defaultStack`.

**Ports in a worktree** come from the ports file. Kept by the team's tooling, or, with `worktrees.ports`, allocated by the dashboard on first start (locked with `<portsFile>.lock`, created exclusively and broken after 10s, so a team script writing the same file can take the same lock). Validate checks offsets are unique, fit in a slot, and that the first ten slots don't land on main's ports or the dashboard's.

Port rules: unique across apps, not the dashboard's, and not a database's host port. Frameworks' defaults (Vite 5173, Next 3000, Angular 4200, Laravel/Django 8000, Rails 3000, Spring 8080) are fine when they don't clash.

## machine.json: the Machine page

```json
{
  "checks": [
    { "use": "package-manager" },
    { "use": "node", "required": { "file": "web/.nvmrc", "min": "20.0.0" }, "apps": ["web"] },
    { "use": "go", "required": { "file": "api/go.mod", "regex": "^go (\\d+\\.\\d+)" }, "apps": ["api"], "group": "Backend" },
    { "use": "git" }, { "use": "gh" }, { "use": "claude" },
    { "use": "docker", "group": "Services" },
    { "use": "docker-container", "id": "mysql", "name": "app-mysql-1", "port": 3306, "label": "MySQL ({image})",
      "image": { "file": "docker-compose.yml", "regex": "image:\\s*(mysql:[^\\s]+)" }, "apps": ["api"], "group": "Services" },
    { "use": "path", "id": "web-deps", "label": "web dependencies", "repo": "web", "path": "web/node_modules",
      "install": { "label": "npm ci", "win": "npm ci", "mac": "npm ci", "linux": "npm ci", "cwd": "web" }, "apps": ["web"] },
    { "use": "python", "optional": true, "when": { "exists": "scripts" }, "group": "Optional" }
  ]
}
```

Each check picks a catalog entry with `use` and overrides any field, or defines one with `kind`. Fields: `id` (defaults to `use`; unique), `group` (section; order = first appearance; default "Everyone"), `label` (`{required}`, `{major}`, `{image}` expand), `apps` (app ids that can't start while it's missing: their cards say "Needs …"), `required` (`"1.2"` or `{ file, regex?, min?, default? }`: read from a repo file; `min` is a floor), `optional` (absent = info, not missing), `when: { exists: "<dir>", os: "win"|"mac"|"linux", profile: "developer"|"reader", role: "<role id>" }` (profile / role: only for people on that profile or in that role, e.g. build tools for developers; either takes a list), `install: { label?, win, mac, linux, cwd? }` (runs in a visible terminal when the user clicks Install; `null` for an OS = no button), `fix` (copyable text; string or per OS), `detail: { ok, missing }`.

**Catalog ids** (`<engine>/server/src/machine-catalog.ts`): `package-manager` (winget/Homebrew), `node`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, `python`, `uv`, `php`, `composer`, `go`, `java`, `maven`, `gradle`, `ruby`, `bundler`, `cargo`, `dotnet`, `dotnet-dev-cert`, `dotnet-user-secrets` (`project`: a csproj with UserSecretsId), `git`, `gh`, `glab`, `claude` (installed **and signed in**, via `claude auth status`; signed out shows a Sign in button that opens a terminal running `claude auth login`), `curl`, `az`, `aws`, `gcloud`, `terraform`, `kubectl`, `docker`, `docker-container` (`name`, `port`, `image`; `setup: false` hides Run setup), `psql`, `mysql`, `redis-cli`, `path` (`path`, `repo`, `cloneFix`; `{exe}` = `.exe` on Windows), `npm-global` (`package`), `env-var` (`name`), `port` (`port`), `copilot` (GitHub Copilot CLI) and `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI, with `codex login status`): agents for runs. They show in an **Agents** group without being listed (signed in, not signed in with Sign in, or not installed as optional with Install); list one only to make it a requirement, `claude-connector` (`connector`: a claude.ai connector's name, e.g. `"Atlassian"`; read from `claude mcp list`: connected, turned off for the project, signed out, or not on the person's claude.ai account; the button opens claude.ai's connector settings). A connector is how Claude itself should reach a tracker or docs host: one browser sign-in, every folder, headless runs included.

**Kinds** for custom checks: `command` (`probe: { cmd: "tool" | { win, mac, linux }, args: [], stream?: "out"|"err"|"both" }`, optional `auth: { cmd, args, detail, signIn: { label, win, mac, linux } }`), plus every kind above. Never put secrets in checks: secrets checks only look for a file and tell the user where it comes from.

Always include: `package-manager`, `node` (the dashboard itself needs it; floor 24.15.0), `git`, the code host CLI (`gh`/`glab`), `claude`. Then each stack's toolchain (from its version pins), `docker` + one `docker-container` per database/service the apps need, and one `path` check per app's installed dependencies.

## docs.json: the Knowledge page (and search)

The Knowledge page (it was Docs; `/docs` links and a `docs` id in `hiddenPages` still work) is what the business knows, grouped by **area**: notes in the team's own storage, docs in the repos, and the tools where the rest lives, each showing whether Claude can reach it.

```json
{
  "areas": [
    { "key": "company", "label": "Company", "owner": "CEO", "description": "Mission, goals, how we work" },
    { "key": "finance", "label": "Finance", "owner": "Dana", "reviewEvery": 90 },
    { "key": "engineering", "label": "Engineering" }
  ],
  "sources": [
    { "key": "finance", "name": "Finance handbook", "kind": "store", "area": "finance",
      "store": { "type": "s3", "bucket": "acme-knowledge", "region": "eu-west-1", "prefix": "finance/" } },
    { "key": "specs", "name": "Product specs", "kind": "external", "url": "https://www.notion.so/acme", "area": "company", "connection": "claude.ai Notion" },
    { "key": "handbook", "name": "Engineering handbook", "kind": "notes", "dir": "handbook", "area": "engineering" },
    { "key": "site", "name": "Docs site", "kind": "site", "dir": "docs-site", "live": "https://docs.acme.com/", "port": 4335 },
    { "key": "wiki", "name": "Confluence", "kind": "external", "url": "https://acme.atlassian.net/wiki", "provider": "confluence", "spaces": ["ENG"], "description": "Runbooks and specs" }
  ]
}
```

**Areas** (optional) group sources on the page: `label`, `owner`, `description`, and `reviewEvery` (days): a note whose frontmatter `reviewed:` date (else its last change) is older than that is flagged "review due", counted on its card and in the sidebar, and cleared with **Mark reviewed** (which sets `reviewed:` to today). A source names its `area`; sources without one are listed last.

**Notes** (`notes` folders and stores) read like an Obsidian vault: a folder tree, `[[wikilinks]]` (`[[note|alias]]`, `[[note#heading]]`, `![[image.png]]`) and relative `.md` links open the note, frontmatter `owner`, `reviewed` and `tags` (plus inline `#tags`) show as chips and filters, and each note lists its backlinks and the links that point at no note yet. An existing Obsidian vault can be used as it is.

`store` = business notes in the team's own bucket, for people without git access (no GitHub seat needed): `store.type` is `s3` (`bucket`, `region`, optional `endpoint` for R2, MinIO and other S3-compatible stores), `gcs` (`bucket`; Google Cloud Storage through its S3-compatible API with an HMAC key) or `azure-blob` (`account`, `container`; `endpoint` for Azurite or sovereign clouds), plus an optional `prefix` (a folder in the bucket). Each person pastes their own key on the page (S3/GCS `ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET`, Azure a container SAS with read, write, delete and list), kept in `.claude/ledger/knowledge-<key>.key`; a hosted dashboard sets `KNOWLEDGE_<KEY>_KEY` instead. Never put a key in docs.json. Different areas can use different buckets or keys, so only Finance's key holders read Finance. The dashboard keeps a local copy in `.claude/ledger/knowledge/<key>/` (synced every few minutes while the page is used, and before a run that uses it), with an `INDEX.md` of every note's title, owner, tags and summary. People create, edit, rename and delete notes on the page; a save that would overwrite someone else's newer change is refused (ETag), and the page offers their version. **Use <name>** in Ask and the launch dialog gives the run the copy to read (`--add-dir`) and tells it to cite the notes; "My Claude sessions can read it" adds the copy to the person's `permissions.additionalDirectories`. Claude reads the copy but doesn't change it: edits go through the page.

`connection` (any source) names the MCP server Claude reaches it through, as the Connections page shows it (`claude.ai Notion`, `plugin:engineering:atlassian`, `notion`), or a list of names any one of which works (the same tool reached another way); the card says whether Claude can reach it and links to Connections when it can't.

**Setting up the team's tools.** The page's **Set up tools** panel (it opens by itself while there are no tools or stores) asks where the team keeps its knowledge: Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, SharePoint / OneDrive, another tool (name, link, and its MCP server's name), or none of these, which sets up a store instead (with the steps the team's admin follows: bucket, key, `KNOWLEDGE_<KEY>_KEY` in the deployment). Saving writes one external source per tool to docs.json (marked `"tool": "<id>"`, with the connector names that reach it as `connection`, and `provider: "confluence"` for Confluence so the page can search it) and one requirement per tool to connections.json (marked `"knowledge": "<id>"`, the other names as `alternatives`), so everyone sees their own status, the sidebar counts what isn't connected for them, and doctor reports it. Saving again replaces only the entries it wrote. A hosted dashboard shows the status but can't change the list (it's the workspace repo's config): commit `.claude/dashboard/` after changing it locally.

`notes` = a folder of Markdown in a repo, rendered in the page (edited in the repo: **Make edits** starts a run). `site` = a static-site repo (HTML); `port` serves the working copy locally for the Page view (pick unused ports), `live` links the published site. `external` = docs elsewhere (Confluence, Notion, Google Drive, SharePoint, a wiki): a card that opens `url`, and "Ask Claude" starts a read-only run that uses that service's MCP connector (the user connects it in Claude). Local sources are also indexed by search.

With a `provider` that has an adapter (`<engine>/server/src/docs-providers/`: `confluence` so far), an external source is also **searchable**: the Docs page searches it and shows its pages, global search (Ctrl+K) lists its matches, and Ask and the launch dialog get a **Use <name>** checkbox that tells the run to search it through the MCP connector and cite pages. Each person reads it with their own key, pasted on the Docs page (kept in `.claude/ledger/`), so they only see what their account can.
- **Confluence**: `"provider": "confluence"`, `url` = `https://<site>.atlassian.net/wiki`, optional `spaces` (space keys; empty = every non-personal space). Key: `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL` + `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN`, the pasted `email:api-token`, or, when `issues.kind` is `jira` on the same site, the Jira key (nothing more to paste).

## infrastructure.json: the Infrastructure page

The page is for **infrastructure only**: cloud accounts and projects, environments, public URLs, databases, egress IPs, firewall rules, DNS. Point it at a doc about something else and it misleads; leave the file out instead. Without it (or when its doc isn't in the workspace) the page explains what belongs there and asks someone with infrastructure access to have Claude fill it in. Workspaces set up before the rename have `reference.json`: the dashboard still reads it, validate asks for the rename, and a `reference` key in hiddenPages, the `/reference` URL and the `referenceSub` wording still work.

```json
{
  "title": "Infrastructure reference",
  "file": "infra/docs/environments.md",
  "lastUpdatedHeader": "Last Updated",
  "groups": [
    { "title": "Accounts", "rows": [{ "label": "AWS account", "header": "AWS Account" }, { "label": "Region", "regex": "region: `([a-z0-9-]+)`" }] },
    { "title": "Egress IPs", "table": "NAT gateways", "label": "Name", "value": "Public IP", "note": "Environment" },
    { "title": "Databases", "kv": [{ "heading": "Production DB", "label": "Production" }, { "heading": "Staging DB", "label": "Staging" }], "value": "Host", "note": ["Engine", "Size"] },
    { "title": "Allowed inbound", "extract": { "table": "Firewall", "column": "Allow", "pattern": "([^,()]+?)\\s*\\((\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3}(?:/\\d{1,2})?)\\)", "noteColumn": "Service" } }
  ]
}
```

The page shows the groups as click-to-copy fact tables, then the whole doc. Group kinds: `rows` (`header` = a `**Header:** value` line; `regex` = first capture group anywhere; `table`+`key`+`match`+`value` = one cell of a key/value table), `table` (one row per row of the pipe table under that exact heading; `label` may be a list of columns (first non-empty wins); `firstOf` keeps the first of a comma list; `noteFromHeading` notes which table it came from), `kv` (one row per key/value table), `extract` (every regex match in one column; merged by label). A group whose table is missing just doesn't show. No `groups` = just the doc. No doc yet? Only write one from real sources (infrastructure code such as Terraform, Helm, CloudFormation, Pulumi or Kubernetes manifests; cloud CLIs the user is signed in to; existing infrastructure docs): a `##` section with a table each for Accounts and projects, Environments, Public URLs, Databases, Egress IPs, Allowed inbound, DNS, never any secrets, and a closing list of what the sources couldn't answer. Nothing to write it from: leave `infrastructure.json` out.

## links.json: the Links page

```json
{
  "categories": [
    { "title": "Apps", "description": "Our apps by environment.", "tiles": [
      { "title": "Web", "description": "Customer app.", "icon": "🌐", "repo": "web", "edit": true,
        "links": [{ "label": "Production", "url": "https://app.acme.com" }, { "label": "Staging", "url": "https://staging.acme.com" }] },
      { "title": "Grafana", "icon": "📈", "url": "https://grafana.acme.com" }
    ] }
  ]
}
```

A tile has one `url` or several `links`. `url`s are `https://…`, `http://…` or a dashboard page (`/docs`, `/infrastructure`). `repo` (a top-level workspace folder) adds Info (its README); `edit: true` adds Make edits (a Claude run in that repo). Users add, edit and delete tiles from the page, for the team (this file) or just themselves (`.claude/ledger/links.local.json`). Seed it from discovery: each app's prod/staging URLs (deploy configs, README), the code host org, the tracker, CI, cloud consoles, monitoring.

## connections.json: the Connections page

The Connections page lists every MCP server Claude reaches from the workspace (claude.ai connectors, plugins' servers, servers in `~/.claude.json` and the workspace's `.mcp.json`) with its live state from `claude mcp list`, and the fixes it can make for that person: **Sign in** (in the page: the server runs `claude mcp login --no-browser` under `script` for a pseudo-terminal, the person opens the sign-in page in their own browser, and the CLI finishes when the browser comes back to its `localhost` callback; when hosted, they paste that address into the page and it is typed at the CLI's prompt; on Windows, which has no `script`, it opens a terminal instead), **Approve** a `.mcp.json` server (`enabledMcpjsonServers` in their `.claude/settings.local.json`), **Add** and **Remove** their own servers (`claude mcp add-json` / `remove`, scope local or user), **Sign out**, and **Runs can use it**. Dashboard runs never ask for permission, so an MCP tool without an allow rule is denied; the checkbox adds `mcp__<server>` (the name with anything but letters, digits, `_` and `-` as `_`) to their `permissions.allow`. Header and env values never reach the browser.

The file is optional and names the servers the team relies on. They show first, with a count in the sidebar for anyone they don't work for, and doctor reports them:

```json
{
  "required": [
    { "name": "claude.ai Linear", "why": "Issues page and Implement runs" },
    { "name": "notion", "why": "Product specs", "add": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp" } },
    { "name": "internal-api", "why": "Order lookups", "add": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.acme.dev/mcp", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${ACME_TOKEN}" } } }
  ]
}
```

`alternatives` (optional) lists other names that meet the requirement (the same tool reached another way, e.g. `"claude.ai Notion"` with `["notion"]`): the first one that's connected carries it, and it's missing only when none is configured. `knowledge` marks a requirement the Knowledge page's setup wrote.

`name` is the name `claude mcp list` shows (`claude.ai <Connector>` for claude.ai connectors, `plugin:<plugin>:<server>` for plugins'). `add` (only for plain names; not for connectors or plugins) is what the page's **Add** button sets up for someone who doesn't have it: `type` `http`/`sse` with `url` and optional `headers`, or `stdio` with `command`, `args`, `env`. Never put a secret in it: write `${VAR}` and the Add dialog asks each person for theirs. A claude.ai connector that's missing points the person at claude.ai's connector settings (an org admin adds it to the organization first). If the team shares servers through a committed `.mcp.json`, list them here too, so people see the ones they haven't approved. Don't list a GitHub MCP server just for GitHub access: the dashboard's GitHub features and runs use the `gh` CLI, which the Machine page checks. List it only when runs need its MCP tools.

## models.json: the Models page (local and team open models)

The Models page (under Agents) lets runs use open models instead of Claude's, for code search and exploring at no Claude cost. A local or team model is Claude Code with another backend: the run's turns start `claude` with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set to an Anthropic-compatible server (Ollama, vLLM, or LiteLLM in front of anything). So runs keep their tools, skills, CLAUDE.md, plan mode and run page. Each model that can call tools appears in Ask and Run's **Model** select after Claude's own: `Local · Qwen3.8 27B` (run model `local/<ollama tag>`), or `<endpoint label> · <model>` (`team/<endpoint id>/<model>`). They take no effort setting, show no dollar cost, and don't count against the Claude usage meters or budgets.

The backend is chosen per turn from the turn's model (`<engine>/server/src/models/routes.ts`). Turns on `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku` or `fable` start exactly as before, on the person's own Claude sign-in (their subscription, when they have one). A local turn clears any provider settings from the shell (Bedrock, Vertex, a gateway's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) and sets its own, so none of them carry over. It also points Claude Code's subagents and background calls at the same model (the server has no Claude models) and turns off Claude Code's non-essential traffic. **Continue in terminal** sets the same variables first. A team token is read from its env var or the token file, never printed. A model that's no longer available stops the launch or reply with a pointer to the Models page; it never falls back to a Claude model.

**Smart routing (experimental, per person).** The Models page's **Explorer** setting makes Claude's runs (Opus, Sonnet…) do their broad code searching on an open model:
- Each Claude turn gets an `Explore` subagent on that model (passed with `--agents`, a file in `.claude/ledger/`). It takes the place of Claude Code's own Explore, so the exploring Claude already chooses to hand off runs free, and Claude does the planning, editing and final answer.
- The turn's requests go through a small router on `127.0.0.1` (`<engine>/server/src/models/router.ts`):
  - The explorer's model goes to its server without the person's Claude credentials, queued one at a time, with keep-alive pings while waiting.
  - Everything else goes on to Anthropic (or the gateway `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` names) unchanged, on the person's own sign-in.
- Off by default. It has no effect on runs that are already on a local or team model. Exploring takes longer on a small model than on Claude.
- A run's "api-equiv" cost includes the explorer's tokens priced as if Claude ran them, so it overstates the real cost.
- Local runs get a rule not to start parallel subagents, because the server answers one request at a time, and a 30-minute request timeout.

**Changing model mid-run.** The reply box on a Claude run has **Next reply on**, plus **Continue with Opus** on a local or team model's run. The session carries on, on the new model.

**On this computer (Ollama).**
- The page shows:
  - the GPU and its memory (`nvidia-smi`; Apple silicon shares RAM),
  - RAM,
  - free disk where Ollama keeps models (`OLLAMA_MODELS`, else `~/.ollama/models`) and how much the downloaded models use,
  - a recommended list (`<engine>/server/src/models/catalog.ts`, refreshed each engine release). Each entry has its download size, context, **tool calling** yes/no, and a rough "fits this computer" verdict: on the GPU, partly on the GPU, CPU only, too big, or not enough disk.
- **Install Ollama** opens a terminal with the catalog's installer (`winget` / `brew` / the install script). The Machine catalog also has it: `{ "use": "ollama" }`.
- **Download** pulls through Ollama's API with byte progress, then makes a twin of the model with a 64k context window (`<tag>-ctx64k`). The twin is an Ollama model `from` the original with `num_ctx` set; it shares the original's files. Runs use the twin, because Claude Code's own instructions are ~20k tokens and Ollama's default window is smaller. A model pulled outside the dashboard gets its twin from **Prepare for runs**. **Delete** removes both.
- A model without tool calling is listed but can't be picked. Claude Code works entirely through tools.
- Hosted dashboards have no local models.

**Team endpoints.** A bigger model the team hosts, listed here for everyone:

```json
{
  "local": { "contextLength": 65536, "recommended": [{ "tag": "granite4.1:3b", "label": "Granite 4.1 3B", "params": "3B", "diskGb": 2.1, "context": 131072, "tools": true, "goodFor": "Old laptops" }], "hide": ["deepseek-r1:14b"] },
  "endpoints": [
    { "id": "gpu", "label": "Team GPU", "baseUrl": "https://llm.example.com", "token": "${TEAM_LLM_TOKEN}",
      "models": [{ "id": "qwen3.8:27b", "label": "Qwen3.8 27B", "tools": true, "context": 262144 }] }
  ]
}
```

- `local` (optional):
  - `contextLength`: the twins' window, from 8192 to 1048576 (default 65536; bigger takes more GPU memory).
  - `recommended`: entries added to, or replacing, the engine's list by `tag`.
  - `hide`: tags to leave out.
- `endpoints[]`:
  - `id`: lowercase letters, digits and dashes; it's part of the run's model name.
  - `baseUrl`: the server's address, without `/v1`; Claude Code adds `/v1/messages`.
  - `token`: always a `${VAR}`, never the secret itself. Leave it out for a server without one. Someone without the variable set saves their own token on the page, in `.claude/ledger/model-tokens.json`; it's never sent back to the browser.
  - `models`: what to offer (`tools: false` hides one). Without `models`, **Test** asks the endpoint's `/v1/models` and offers what it lists.
- The page's **Test** checks the endpoint is reachable and the token is accepted.
- See [hosting.md](hosting.md#hosting-a-model-for-the-team) for running one.

## deck.json: skill cards, routines, limits, Issues view

```json
{
  "limits": { "maxConcurrentRuns": 3, "pauseAtSessionPct": 90, "pauseAtWeeklyPct": 90 },
  "defaults": { "model": "opus", "effort": "medium" },
  "presets": [
    { "id": "brief", "label": "Morning brief", "icon": "sun", "description": "Open PRs, red CI, my issues. Read-only.",
      "prompt": "Give me a short morning brief: my open PRs and their checks (gh), failing CI on main, and my in-progress issues. End with the 3 things to do first. Don't change anything.",

      "prompt": "/implement {ticket}",
      "args": [{ "name": "ticket", "label": "Ticket", "placeholder": "ENG-123", "pattern": "^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-\\d+$" }],
      "options": [{ "name": "auto", "label": "Decide open questions on its own (--auto)", "append": " --auto", "default": false }],
      "permissionMode": "auto" }
  ],

  "routines": [{ "id": "weekday-brief", "preset": "brief", "at": "08:30", "days": "weekdays", "enabled": false }]
}
```

**Agents.** Runs can use Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI or OpenAI Codex CLI (`<engine>/server/src/agents/`). Ask and the launch dialog show an **Agent** select next to Model and Effort when more than one is installed and signed in on the machine; picking one swaps in its models and efforts (Copilot's from `copilot help config`, Codex's from `~/.codex/models_cache.json`) and is remembered in the browser. `defaults.agent` (`claude` | `copilot` | `codex`) sets the workspace's default; `defaults.model`/`effort` are Claude's (another agent starts on its own defaults). Claude's Model select also lists the Models page's local and team open models (see models.json above); `defaults.model` or a preset's `model` can name one (`local/<tag>`, `team/<endpoint>/<model>`), e.g. an explore preset that runs locally. A run keeps its agent: replies resume the same session, and Continue in terminal runs that agent's resume command. Copilot and Codex get the dashboard's rules at the top of the first prompt (they have no system-prompt flag); plan mode is `--deny-tool write` for Copilot and the read-only sandbox for Codex; Codex edits in its workspace-write sandbox with network on. Team instructions: Copilot reads the workspace's CLAUDE.md itself; Codex reads AGENTS.md, so its runs (and Continue in terminal) pass `-c "project_doc_fallback_filenames=['CLAUDE.md']"` (add `project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]` to `~/.codex/config.toml` for your own Codex sessions). Skills: a Copilot or Codex prompt that starts with `/name args` (Issues' Implement, a preset, a slash in Ask) gets the workspace skill's instructions (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, or `.claude/commands/<name>.md`) with the arguments filled in; the run page still shows what was typed. Connections has a tab per installed agent: Copilot's and Codex's own MCP servers (their `mcp list --json`), add and remove, Codex's sign-in, and **Copy from Claude** (Claude's own and workspace servers by their config, claude.ai connectors by their address; the other agent signs in itself; Copilot already reads `.mcp.json`). Claude-only parts (the dollar cap, plan-usage meters, background-task tracking, connections.json requirements, memory) don't apply to them.

Presets are the Home page's skill cards: `prompt` (with `{arg}` placeholders), `args` (`pattern` validates), `options` (checkboxes that `append` text), `agent`, `model`/`effort`/`permissionMode` (`auto` | `acceptEdits` | `dontAsk` | `plan`), `budgetUsd` (only used when the per-run cap is on in Settings), `pickWorkspace`, `workspace`. Icons: `sun`, `download`, `eye`, `package`, `shield`, `bolt`, `terminal`, and the nav icons. `issues`: which teams (Linear teams / Jira projects / GitHub repos) and states the board shows (empty = all; states in column order), the preset Implement runs, and which teams get Implement (empty = all). `routines` fire presets on a schedule while the dashboard runs (off by default). Everyone can override limits and defaults for themselves on the Settings page.

## repos.json: the Repos page (workspace root)

The repos the workspace is made of, each cloned to `<workspace>/<relativePath>`. It sits at the workspace root, not in `.claude/dashboard/`, because the team's own skills (worktrees, pulls) read it too. Schema: `<engine>/shared/repos.schema.json` (point `$schema` at it for editor checks).

```json
{
  "$schema": "./natterjack/shared/repos.schema.json",
  "repos": [
    { "name": "api", "relativePath": "services/api", "remote": "https://github.com/acme/api.git", "layer": "backend", "dependencies": [] },
    { "name": "web", "relativePath": "web", "remote": "https://github.com/acme/web.git", "layer": "frontend", "defaultBranch": "main" }
  ]
}
```

Only `name` is required; `relativePath` defaults to it and must stay inside the workspace (no absolute paths, no `..`). `remote` is what `git clone` is given; without one the Repos page can only report the repo. `layer` groups the page; `dependencies` (other repos' names) is for implementation and PR order. The older `directory` / `url` names are still read everywhere, and `validate.mjs` warns about them.

The Repos page lists each repo as cloned (branch, uncommitted file count), missing, or a folder with files but no `.git` (left alone). **Clone missing** runs `git clone -- <remote> <relativePath>` for missing repos with a remote, as a job in Activity / Logs; a folder that already has files is never touched. Git runs with terminal prompts off, so a remote needing a password fails with a message instead of hanging (a credential helper with its own sign-in window still works). `discover.mjs` and `doctor.mjs` read the file the same way.

### Snapshots: the code for people who can't clone

A top-level `snapshot` block names where read-only copies of the repos are published, so people without git access (or without access to the code host) can still have the code on disk for Ask, Explore and Docs:

```json
"snapshot": { "source": "confluence", "site": "acme.atlassian.net", "pageId": "123456", "maxFileMb": 100 }
"snapshot": { "source": "http", "baseUrl": "https://files.acme.com/code", "auth": "none" }
"snapshot": { "source": "azure-blob", "account": "acmecode", "container": "snapshots" }
"snapshot": { "source": "s3", "bucket": "acme-code", "region": "eu-west-1", "prefix": "snapshots/" }
```

- **Publish** (CI, nightly): `node <engine>/bin/snapshot.mjs publish --clone` shallow-clones missing repos, fetches each repo's **default branch from origin** (`defaultBranch` in repos.json, else origin's HEAD) and runs `git archive` on that commit into `<name>-<commit>.tar.gz` (files as committed, no history), whatever the clone has checked out, so a work branch or uncommitted changes are never published. It zips the workspace root's default branch into `workspace-<commit>.zip`, and uploads them with `snapshot-manifest.json` (each file's commit, size, date) last. File names carry the commit, so an interrupted publish never changes a file the current manifest names. Once the new manifest is up, files that only the previous manifest named are deleted, and old versions of the snapshot's own files are pruned; other files at the source are left alone. `--dry --out <dir>` builds without uploading (to check sizes); `--no-fetch` uses the origin refs the clones already have; `"snapshot": false` on a repo leaves it out. It needs git ≥ 2.40, and the source's credentials in the environment.
- **Publish now** (the Repos page, developer profile, a source that takes uploads): the same, with your own key for the source. It first lists what would go up (each repo's branch, commit and message, fetched just then) and publishes exactly that after you confirm, as a job. Repos you haven't cloned, or without an origin, are skipped, and their last published copy stays in the manifest if the file is still at the source.
- **Download** (the Repos page): connect the source (each person's own key, kept in the ledger), then **Download code** / **Update code**. Each archive is extracted next to its folder, stamped (`.snapshot.json`), and swapped in whole; the old copy goes only once the new one is in place. A folder with `.git`, or with files and no stamp, is never replaced. The first download sets the reader profile unless the person already chose one (with `roles`, they are still asked which role).
- **Getting started with no git at all (Windows)**: each publish also uploads `Install-<name>.cmd` (confluence and http sources), generated from `<engine>/bin/install-windows.ps1` with the source filled in. Double-clicking it sets up or updates everything for that user, with no admin rights needed:
  - Node.js at the dashboard's floor: the one on PATH, else a portable copy in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\natterjack\node`, checked against nodejs.org's SHASUMS256.
  - Claude Code: Anthropic's per-user installer.
  - The source's key, asked for once and saved in the ledger.
  - `workspace.zip` and the built UI, extracted into the folder the user picks. It never extracts over a git clone, and the user's ledger and downloaded repos are kept.
  - It asks for the role first (when `workspace.json` has `roles`), then starts the dashboard, sets that role (else the reader profile), starts Download code, and adds a desktop shortcut.

  Running the installer again updates the workspace files.
- **Pre-built UI**: publish adds `dashboard-ui.tar.gz`, the publisher's `<engine>/dist` marked with `.prebuilt.json`, when `<engine>/` there is exactly the published commit and its build is current (in CI: run `npm ci && npm run build` in `<engine>/` before publishing). The manifest records the folder (`ui.dir`); installs put the UI where the workspace's `engine.json` says. `dashboard.mjs start` then needs neither npm nor a build, since the server only uses Node itself. Without it, the first start runs `npm ci` and `ng build`, which takes a few minutes.
- **By hand, or on another OS**: download `workspace.zip` from the source, extract it, and run `node <engine>/bin/dashboard.mjs start`; the Repos page does the rest.
- **Install with no git (hosted containers, scripts)**: `node <engine>/bin/snapshot.mjs install --into <dir> [--repos]` installs or updates a whole workspace from the source. It puts the workspace zip over `<dir>`, then the prebuilt UI, then, with `--repos`, every repo that's missing or older.
  - It only writes to a folder that's absent, empty or installed this way, never to a git clone, and the ledger is kept.
  - Before the first install there's no `repos.json` to read, so it takes the source from `SNAPSHOT_CONFIG` (the `snapshot` block as JSON) and the credentials from the environment.
  - The hosted image runs it on boot (hosting.md).
  - Files deleted from the workspace stay until the folder is installed fresh.

Sources (`<engine>/server/src/snapshot-sources/`; adding one: `references/adapters.md`):

| source | settings | who can download | publishing credentials |
|---|---|---|---|
| `confluence` | `site`, `pageId` (the page the files are attached to), `maxFileMb` (the site's attachment limit, 100 by default on Cloud) | whoever can view the page; the key is the Docs page's Confluence key, or Jira's on the same site | `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL` + `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN` of an account that can edit the page |
| `http` | `baseUrl`, `auth` (`none` / `bearer` / `basic`) | anyone with the link (and the key, with auth); the key is pasted on the Repos page or set as `SNAPSHOT_HTTP_TOKEN` | none: download-only; copy the `--out` folder to the server yourself |
| `azure-blob` | `account`, `container`, `prefix` (a folder in it), `endpoint` (instead of `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net`: Azurite, sovereign clouds) | anyone with a SAS token for the container that can read and list. The token is pasted on the Repos page (the part after `?`, or the whole URL) or set as `SNAPSHOT_AZURE_SAS`. Issue it from a stored access policy so it can be revoked. | `SNAPSHOT_AZURE_SAS` with write and delete as well (and delete-version, with blob versioning on, to prune) |
| `s3` | `bucket`, `region` (default `us-east-1`; `auto` for R2), `prefix`, `endpoint` (any S3-compatible store: Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Google Cloud Storage's interop API, Backblaze B2; path-style) | anyone with an access key that has `s3:ListBucket` + `s3:GetObject`, pasted as `ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or set as `SNAPSHOT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `SNAPSHOT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (+ `SNAPSHOT_S3_SESSION_TOKEN`), else the standard `AWS_*` variables | the same, with `s3:PutObject` + `s3:DeleteObject` (and `s3:ListBucketVersions` + `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`, with versioning on, to prune) |

The Windows installer (`Install-<name>.cmd`) is published for `confluence` and `http` only. For the object stores, use `snapshot.mjs install`, or give people the workspace zip by hand.

## brand/: the look

`brand/theme.css` is served at `/ds/theme.css`, after the dashboard's neutral defaults (`/ds/tokens.css`). It `@import`s the team's token files (copied into `brand/` verbatim) and maps them onto the contract. Other files in `brand/` (the logo, favicon, fonts) are served at `/ds/<file>`. See `branding.md`.

## engine.json: the installed engine

Written by scaffold, updated by upgrade; don't edit it by hand.

```json
{ "version": "0.8.0", "dir": "natterjack", "sourceRepo": "https://github.com/lhoezee/skills", "tag": "natterjack-v0.8.0", "installedAt": "…" }
```

- **`version`**: the engine version installed, the base upgrade merges from.
- **`dir`**: the folder the engine is in, relative to the workspace with forward slashes (`natterjack`, `tools/ops-console`). Not absolute, no `..`, not under `.claude/`. Without it the engine is in `dashboard/` (workspaces set up before the folder was configurable). The scripts, the dashboard, the snapshot installer and the hosted image all read it. `.claude/dashboard/` and `.claude/ledger/` stay where they are whatever the folder: the engine finds the workspace by walking up to the nearest folder that has `.claude/dashboard/`.

In these docs `<engine>/` means that folder.

## plan.json: input to scaffold.mjs

```json
{
  "workspace": { … }, "apps": { … }, "machine": { … }, "docs": { … }, "infrastructure": { … }, "links": { … }, "connections": { … }, "deck": { … },
  "repos": [{ "name": "API", "relativePath": "api", "remote": "https://github.com/acme/api.git", "dependencies": [] }],
  "engineDir": "natterjack",
  "skillName": "natterjack",
  "skills": ["dashboard"],
  "claudeMd": true
}
```

Only `workspace` is required. scaffold never overwrites an existing config file unless `--force`.

- **`engineDir`** (default `natterjack`; `--engine-dir` overrides it): where the engine goes, recorded as engine.json `dir`. Pick another when the workspace already has a folder or skill by that name, e.g. `tools/natterjack`. scaffold refuses a folder that's already something else, one that overlaps a repo, and moving an engine that's already installed. `.gitignore` gets its `node_modules/`, `dist/` and `.angular/` (and, allow-list style, the folder and its parents).
- **`skillName`** (default: the last folder of `engineDir`, e.g. `natterjack` or `ops-console`): the name the workspace's dashboard skill is installed under (`.claude/skills/<skillName>/`, run as `/<skillName>`). `"dashboard"` in `skills` means that skill.
