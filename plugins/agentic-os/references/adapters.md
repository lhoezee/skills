# Issue tracker adapters

The Issues page, Explain / Implement, search, and the ticket strip on runs all go through one `IssueTracker`, chosen by `workspace.json` `issues.kind`. Adapters live in `dashboard/server/src/issues/`: `linear.ts` (GraphQL, pasted key), `jira.ts` (REST v3, pasted `email:token`), `github.ts` (the `gh` CLI's own login). The dashboard reads the tracker directly with each person's own credentials: refreshing the board costs no Claude usage, and everyone sees what their account can see. Claude *runs* that need the tracker (Implement, a morning brief) use its MCP connector instead.

## The interface (`issues/index.ts`)

```ts
interface IssueTracker {
  kind: string;
  cache: { issues: Issue[] } | null;            // last good list (search indexes it)
  status(): { connected: boolean; source: "env" | "file" | "cli" | null; viewer: string | null };
  connectHelp(): { title: string; steps: string[] /* markdown */; placeholder: string; needsKey: boolean } | null;
  connect(key: string): Promise<status>;         // validate with a cheap "who am I" call, then save (mode 600)
  disconnect(): status;
  issues(filter: { teams: string[]; states: string[]; query?: string }, force?: boolean): Promise<{ connected: boolean; issues: Issue[]; fetchedAt?: number; error?: string | null }>;
  issue(id: string): Promise<IssueDetail>;
  issueUrl(id: string): string | null;
  queryHelp(): { label: string; placeholder: string; help: string } | null;   // null = no query language
}
```

Normalized shapes (`shared/api.ts`):
- **Issue**: `id` (the ticket id people type: `ENG-12`, `api#42`), `title`, `url`, `team` (whatever the tracker groups by: Linear team, Jira project, GitHub repo), `teamKey`, `state` (board column), `stateColor?` (hex), `priority` (1 = urgent … 4 = low, 0 = none), `priorityLabel`, `assignee`, `project` (milestone / fix version / project), `labels: [{ name, color }]`, `updatedAt` (ISO).
- **IssueDetail**: `id`, `title`, `url`, `team`, `state`, `priorityLabel`, `assignee`, `project`, `cycle` (sprint/cycle/iteration), `labels`, `description` (**markdown**: convert rich text such as Jira's ADF), `branchName`, `updatedAt`.

`filter.teams` / `filter.states` are names from `deck.json` `issues`; empty means all (don't send an empty `IN ()`). The server adds `canImplement`, `hasWorktree` and `lastRun` itself.

`filter.query` is the viewer's own board filter ("My filter" on the Issues page, saved in their `.claude/ledger/settings.json`), in the tracker's own language: Jira ANDs it into the JQL in parentheses, GitHub passes it to `gh issue list --search`. Validate it at the top of `issues()` and throw (the page shows "Your filter: …"); cache per filter, so a changed query refetches. A tracker with no query language returns `null` from `queryHelp()` (Linear) and the field doesn't show.

## Conventions

- **Credentials**: a personal token the user pastes on the Issues page, saved to `<ledger>/<kind>-api-key` with mode 0600, or an env var (document both in `connectHelp`); or an already-authenticated CLI (`needsKey: false`). Never a shared key in committed config, never OAuth flows, never send the key to the browser.
- **Caching**: 60s; one request in flight at a time; on error keep the last good list and set `error` (the page shows it above the stale board).
- **No dependencies**: `node:https`, `node:child_process`. Timeouts on every request (20s).
- **Limits**: one request for the board where possible, ≤ ~250 issues, ordered by recently updated.
- **Defaults**: add the kind to `TRACKER_DEFAULTS` in `server/src/config.ts`: its `label`, `implementStates`, and `ticketPattern` if ids aren't `KEY-123`.
- **Register** it in `ADAPTERS` in `issues/index.ts`.

## Checklist for a new tracker

Azure Boards (WIQL + work items API, PAT with Basic auth), Shortcut (REST, `Shortcut-Token` header, ids `sc-123`), GitLab Issues (`glab` CLI or REST with a PAT; ids `<project>#<iid>`), YouTrack (REST, permanent token), ClickUp / Asana / Monday (REST, personal tokens).

1. Auth that works with a personal token, and a "who am I" endpoint for `connect`.
2. Query for the board: filter by team/project and state names; include state color if the API has one.
3. One-issue endpoint with the description (convert to markdown).
4. The id people use in branches and commits; its regex for `ticketPattern`.
5. Tests for the pure parts (query building, mapping, description conversion) in `server/test/issues.test.ts`; then connect for real on the Issues page, and try Explain.

## Code hosts (the Needs-you inbox)

`server/src/inbox.ts` reads the code host for "my open PRs (checks, reviews, conflicts)", "reviews requested from me" and "CI on the default branch" of `codeHost.ciRepos`. `github` uses the `gh` CLI. Another host is a branch in `get()` keyed on `workspaceConfig().codeHost.kind` returning the same `{ items, ciHealth, errors }` shape (e.g. `glab mr list --author=@me`, `glab ci status`).

## Docs providers (searchable external docs)

A docs.json source with `"kind": "external", "provider": "<kind>"` becomes searchable when `dashboard/server/src/docs-providers/` has an adapter for it (`confluence.ts` so far): the Docs page searches and reads it, global search lists its matches, and runs can be told to use it ("Use <name>"). The interface (`docs-providers/index.ts`):

```ts
interface DocsProvider {
  kind: string; label: string;
  status(): { connected: boolean; source: "env" | "file" | "tracker" | null; viewer: string | null };
  connectHelp(): { title; steps: string[] /* markdown */; placeholder; needsKey } | null;
  connect(key: string): Promise<status>;      // validate with a "who am I" call, then save to <ledger>/<kind>-api-token (mode 600)
  disconnect(): status;
  spaces(): Promise<{ key; name; url }[]>;   // whatever the service groups pages by (spaces, teamspaces, drives)
  search(query: string, spaces: string[], limit?: number): Promise<DocHit[]>;   // empty query = recently updated
  page(id: string): Promise<DocPage>;         // body as HTML with absolute links; the UI sanitizes it
  runNote(pageId?: string | null): string;    // appended to a run's system prompt: which MCP tools to use, what to cite
}
```

Same conventions as trackers: each person's own key (never a shared one in config, never OAuth), `node:https` only, 20s timeouts, errors with a `status` (400 = bad input, 401/403 = reconnect). If the service shares a login with the issue tracker (Confluence and Jira), reuse the tracker's key when the site matches, so there's nothing more to paste. Register it in `PROVIDERS` in `docs-providers/index.ts`; test the pure parts (query building, result mapping) in `server/test/docs-providers.test.ts`.

Candidates: Notion (`POST /v1/search`, integration token; pages → blocks to HTML), Google Drive (Drive v3 `files.list` with `fullText contains`, export Docs as HTML; needs OAuth, so probably a CLI such as `gcloud` instead), SharePoint/OneDrive (Microsoft Graph search), GitBook, Guru, Slab.

## Snapshot sources (the code for people who can't clone)

repos.json `snapshot.source` picks where read-only copies of the repos are published and downloaded from (config: `references/config.md`, "Snapshots"). Adapters live in `dashboard/server/src/snapshot-sources/`: `confluence.ts` (attachments on one page, REST v1, the Docs page's Confluence key) and `http.ts` (any direct-link host, download only). An adapter only moves files by name; `snapshot.ts` owns the archives, the manifest (`manifest.ts`), extraction and the swap. The interface (`snapshot-sources/index.ts`):

```ts
interface SnapshotSource {
  kind: string; label: string;
  maxFileBytes: number | null;                 // publish refuses anything bigger
  status(): { connected: boolean; source: "env" | "file" | "tracker" | null; viewer: string | null };
  connectHelp(): { title; steps: string[] /* markdown */; placeholder; needsKey; method?: "key" | "oauth" } | null;
  connect(key: string): Promise<status>;       // validate first, then save to <ledger>/<file> (mode 600)
  disconnect(): status;
  list(): Promise<{ id; name; size; updatedAt }[]>;   // must include snapshot-manifest.json once published
  download(file, destPath: string): Promise<void>;     // stream to disk (http-util.ts downloadFile)
  upload?(name: string, srcPath: string): Promise<void>;   // publishing: create or replace by name
  remove?(file): Promise<void>;                // publishing: delete a file the new manifest no longer names
  prune?(names: string[]): Promise<number>;    // publishing: drop old versions of these files only (the source may hold others)
}
```

Conventions: each person's own key for downloads (the service's own permissions decide who gets the code); publishing credentials from the environment, since it runs in CI. Use `http-util.ts` (`request`, `requestJson`, `downloadFile`, `multipartFile`): it streams, follows redirects, and drops `Authorization` on a redirect to another host (Confluence hands downloads to a media host with a signed URL). Reuse an existing login where there is one (`confluence.ts` wraps the Docs provider for its key). `method: "oauth"` is reserved for a sign-in-with flow: an adapter that has one returns its authorize URL from `connect`; nothing implements it yet, because it needs an app each company registers itself (a secret shipped in the plugin wouldn't be secret). Register it in `SOURCES`, add its required settings to `validate.mjs` and a `oneOf` branch to `shared/repos.schema.json`, and give it a case in `server/test/snapshot.test.ts` against a local fake server (list, download through a redirect, upload, prune).

Candidates: SharePoint / OneDrive (Microsoft Graph drive items; `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` is pre-signed; upload sessions for files over 4 MB), Google Drive (Drive v3 `files.list` in a folder, `alt=media`; resumable uploads), Notion (its file-upload API, and file blocks with short-lived signed URLs; size limits depend on the plan), S3 with signed uploads (`http` already downloads). Check each service's current API docs before building: none of these is verified.
