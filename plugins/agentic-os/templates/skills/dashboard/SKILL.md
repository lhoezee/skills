name: dashboard
description: Start, stop, restart or check the workspace dashboard (the local web console for runs, issues, apps, machine setup, docs and links). Use when the user wants to open, start, launch, restart, reload, stop or check the dashboard, or after pulling updates to dashboard/. Also use when a dashboard page looks broken right after an update (it usually just needs a restart).
argument-hint: "[start|stop|restart|status]"

# Workspace dashboard

The dashboard lives in `dashboard/` (code) and `.claude/dashboard/` (this team's config). One script runs it:

```bash
node dashboard/bin/dashboard.mjs start --open   # install + build if needed, run detached, open the browser
node dashboard/bin/dashboard.mjs status
node dashboard/bin/dashboard.mjs restart        # after pulling changes to dashboard/
node dashboard/bin/dashboard.mjs stop
```

Pick the command from what the user asked; `start` is the default. Run it in the foreground: the first start installs packages and builds the UI (a minute or two) and prints progress; after that it returns in a second. The server then keeps running on its own, so never use `run_in_background` for it.

Things to know:
- The port is `dashboard.port` in `.claude/dashboard/workspace.json` (default 3333). A `DASHBOARD_PORT` environment variable overrides it for one machine; `--port N` overrides it for one start.
- **Restarting or stopping ends any Claude run in progress in the dashboard** (it shows as interrupted, and replying to it carries on). If you are yourself running inside the dashboard (a headless run), don't restart it: that would end this run. Tell the user to run the command in a terminal instead.
- It needs Node.js at the version in `dashboard/package.json` `engines` or newer. If the default `node` is older, the script uses a newer one installed with nvm; if there isn't one, it says how to install it.
- If a page is empty or says "not set up", the matching file in `.claude/dashboard/` is missing or wrong; the page says which. Edits to those files apply on the next page load, no restart needed (except the port).
- Logs: `.claude/ledger/dashboard.log`.
